# Python Chess Engine
A chess engine made entirely from scratch in Python.

Can be played using either the terminal by running main.py, or through a web browser on http://localhost:5000 by running app.py (requires Flask).

- Pieces are represented with an individual class for each piece. Their main role is to find possible moves for the piece, using the getMoves() function.
